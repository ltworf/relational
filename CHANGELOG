  and all the symbols are shown.

1.0
- Adds history in the GUI
- Adds menus to the GUI
- Checks if given name to relations are valid
- Discards the old and not so functional tlb format
- Float type recognition is more robust, now handled using a regexp
- Date type recognition is more robust, now using a combination of regexp plus date object
- Integer type recognition now allows negative numbers in relations
- Rename operations are now much faster, content won't be copied unless subsequent updates, insert, updates or deletes will occur
- Added testsuite
- Module parallel does something, can execute queries in parallel
- Implemented select_union_intersect_subtract general optimization
- Removed encoding from .desktop file (was deprecated)
- Added manpage for relational-cli

- Tuples are internally mapped on tuples and no longer on lists
- Set hash method for the classes
- Parsing of strings representing dates is now cached, eliminating the need for double parse
- Fixed python expression tokenization, now uses native tokenizer
- Fixed optimization involving selection and parenthesis in the expression (Rev 260)
- Fixed futile_union_intersection_subtraction optimization that didn't work when selection operator was in the left subtree (Rev 261)
- Restyle of the GUI, splitters added

0.11
- Font is set only on windows (Rev 206)

- Improved futile_union_intersection_subtraction, handles when a branch of subtracion has a selection (Rev 209)
- Can load relations specified in command line (Rev 210)

- Added division operator

0.10
- In optimizer, added a function that tokenizes an expression
- Document about complexity of operations

- Relation module has SQL-like delete
- Relation module has SQL-like update
- Relation module has SQL-like insert
- GUI can be used to insert and delete tuples
- Showing fields of selected relation will work with themes different than oxygen

0.7
- Added README
- Expressions between quotes aren't parsed anymore
- When adding a relation, the file must be chosen 1st, and then the default relation's name is the same as the filename
- Changed internal rename method. Now uses a dictionary
